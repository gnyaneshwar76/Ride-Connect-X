/**
 * Whether Android will let the app keep the vehicle link alive in the rider's
 * pocket, and a way to ask for it.
 *
 * This is battery-optimisation exemption. It was previously shown as a row that
 * always read "not granted" and, when tapped, opened the app's *App info* page —
 * from which the rider had to know that "Battery" was the sub-page they wanted
 * and that "Unrestricted" was the setting inside it. That is fine if you already
 * know Android; it is a dead end if you do not.
 *
 * [request] fires the system's own one-tap dialog instead, and [isExempt] reads
 * the real state so the row can show a tick once it is on.
