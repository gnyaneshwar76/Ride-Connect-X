/**
 * The "Liquid Glass" surface, ported from the Figma export of 16 August 2026.
 *
 * Every number here comes from `GDK` / `GLT` in that file — Figma delivered the
 * token set as explicit values precisely so it could be typed in rather than
 * eyeballed. Do not adjust these by feel; change them in Figma and re-port.
 *
 * ## About the blur
 *
 * **Never use `Modifier.blur` for this.** It blurs the node's *own* content —
 * its text and icons — not what is behind it. Reaching for it produced exactly
 * that: frosted panels with their labels smeared away to nothing.
 *
 * Real backdrop blur comes from Haze: a screen marks its background with
 * [Modifier.hazeBackdrop] and each surface samples it through [hazeChild].
 * That is what gives the Apple-style frosting.
 *
 * `RenderEffect` needs Android 12 (API 31). Below that Haze cannot blur, so the
 * surface falls back to [GlassTokens.fallback] — an opaque colour Figma chose
 * to sit closest to the blurred result, because a transparent panel with no
 * blur over a photograph is unreadable.
