/**
 * What the scooter actually sends in a 0x37 frame.
 *
 * Decoded 4 August 2026 against the rider's Access 125: the ASCII digits at
 * bytes 2..22 split 9/6/6 into odometer, Trip A and Trip B, and matched the
 * cluster exactly (ODO 1602 km, Trip A 198.7 km, Trip B 1079.2 km).
 *
 * Deliberately absent: **speed**, **fuel economy (km/L)** and **battery
 * voltage**. The cluster shows those, but they are not in the frame — the
 * scooter never transmits them, so nothing downstream should pretend to know
 * them.
