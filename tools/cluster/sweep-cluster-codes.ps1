# Steps through Suzuki cluster maneuver codes so a human can record what each

# Which Mappls maneuver maps to which cluster code is recovered from the
# official app. What each cluster code *renders* lives in dashboard firmware and
# is written down nowhere — so it gets established by looking at it.

# Usage:  .\sweep-cluster-codes.ps1                 (codes 1..52)
#         .\sweep-cluster-codes.ps1 -From 38 -To 53 (a narrower range)
#         .\sweep-cluster-codes.ps1 -Hold 6         (longer per code)
