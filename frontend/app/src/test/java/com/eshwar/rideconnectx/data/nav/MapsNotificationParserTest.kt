/**
 * The parser, checked against the field layout Google Maps really uses.
 *
 * **These tests used to be wrong in the same way the parser was.** They passed
 * the instruction as `title` and the distance as `text`, matching the parser's
 * assumption rather than the phone's behaviour — so all of them passed while a
 * whole ride relayed nothing but straight-ahead. Captured from the rider's
 * phone on 6 August 2026:
 *
 * ```
 * title   = "350 m"                                ← distance to the turn
 * text    = "Turn right onto Ring Road"            ← the instruction
 * subText = "1 hr 12 min · 38 km · 1:38 am ETA"    ← duration, remaining, ETA
 * ```
 *
 * Everything below goes through [maps], which puts the arguments in that order,
 * so a test cannot silently drift back to the old shape.
